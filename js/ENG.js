Working outside the traditions of commercial film, experimental filmmakers take alternative approaches not only to narrative but also to visual representation, sound production, and editing, often exploiting new or unconventional technologies to achieve their effects. The course will also consider critical and theoretical perspectives, situating the unconventional techniques of experimental film in relation to broader aesthetic, cultural, historical, and political contexts.

This course focuses on texts that reflects medical experiences from the perspective of individual patients, practitioners and in the case of epidemics, societies. It uses reading, writing, thinking and discussion of those texts to investigate the different perspectives and belief systems that come into play in medical contexts, addressing issues of medical authority, end (quality) of life, the role of genre and technology in mediating the experience of illness, and the ways in which structural inequities in discourses of health are perpetuated.

Accordingly, this course asks: What can words do at a time of environmental crisis? How can literature help us perceive, understand, analyze, narrate, and respond within a continually changing ecology?
