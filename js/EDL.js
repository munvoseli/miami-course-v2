In this second semester of the course, we will specifically focus on the global manifestations of nationhood, sovereignty, and self-determination in classic governmental structures, like constitutions, and in locations or activities that are not normally associated with issues of political or economic sovereignty, like art. Through this exploration, we will attempt to develop a framework of comparative indigenous nationhood.

The ecological observations of the second course will be heavily influenced by the seasonal transition from winter into summer that occurs during the spring semester. From these observations, the class will create a shared understanding of the web of relationships that links humans, animals, plants, landscapes, other-than-human beings, and the stories that one particular group of humans \"the Myaamiaki\" have told about these interactions over time. Through an exploration of some of the general aspects of Myaamia ecology and history, each individual participant of the class will begin develop their own personalized understanding of this complex web of relationships. Half of the class meetings will be dedicated to discussing historical topics, i.e. focused on the past, but one of our explicit goals is to discuss how historical understandings and ecological practices are a part of, or can be made a part of, our contemporary lives. The second semester of this course will more explicitly focus on traditional stories and historical narratives. These oral and textual sources will be used to contextualize the ecological knowledge that students began developing in the first semester of the course.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"17:40","endTime":"18:35","room":"415","buildingCode":"MCG","buildingName":"McGuffey Hall","days":"T","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"IRONSTGM","nameLast":"Ironstrack","nameFirst":"George","nameMiddle":"Michael","namePrefix":"Mr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"George Michael Ironstrack","nameDisplayFormal":"Mr. George Michael Ironstrack","nameSortedInformal":"Ironstrack, George  Michael","nameSortedFormal":"Ironstrack, George Michael Mr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/IRONSTGM","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/89748.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/89748","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"25736","recordNumber":"48","courseCode":"EDL 318A B","schoolCode":"EA","schoolName":"Col of Educ, Health & Society","deptName":"Educational Leadership","deptCode":"EDL","standardizedDivisionCode":"EHS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Education Health & Society","standardizedDeptCode":"EDL","standardizedDeptName":"Educational Leadership","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"EDL","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Educational Leadership","courseTitle":"Teacher Ldrshp:Adolescent Educ","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"EDL","courseSubjectDesc":"Educational Leadership","courseNumber":"318A","courseSectionCode":"B","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"24","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"24","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"318 Teacher Leadership and School Organization (3) This course is designed to challenge and shape students' conceptions of educational organizations and cultures; their professional development as teachers and\/or educational staff members; as well as the acts of teaching, curriculum development, teaming and leadership.

Sexuality, Youth, Education (3)\n\nThis interdisciplinary course utilizes insights from a variety of areas - such as literature, sociology, popular culture, law, and medicine - to analyze how contemporary discourses of sexuality are viewed from multiple perspectives. The course investigates how discourses of sexuality co-mingle with discourses of youth with special attention to the intersections of race, ethnicity, class, gender, nationality and ability. Working from a Critical Youth Studies (CYS) framework and similar theoretical positions, the course privileges scholarship and community-based educational models which foreground issues of equity, social justice, and youth participatory activism. Central questions addressed throughout the course include: What is sexuality, and what does race have to do with it? How are notions of innocence, purity, risk and danger tied to particular bodies, identities and desires? How do the logics, structures and processes of late capitalism and globalization shape the cultural politics of sexuality?","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"13:15","endTime":"14:35","room":"126","buildingCode":"MCG","buildingName":"McGuffey Hall","days":"MW","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"WEEMSLD","nameLast":"Weems","nameFirst":"Lisa","nameMiddle":"D.","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Lisa D.
