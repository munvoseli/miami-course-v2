We will introduce advanced operations and functions in in-memory cluster computing and non-relational storage solutions, and investigate how to integrate various data sources into a data lake. We will also discuss how data governance can help to improve the management and quality of big data. Moreover, we will examine advanced analytics functions enabled by in-memory cluster computing, such as distributed machine learning, real-time analytics on streaming data, and large-scale social network analysis. Following that, we will cover data-driven modern AI technologies, such as natural language processing, speech recognition, image processing and dialog generation. Those topics will be taught in an applied way, without focusing too much on the theory.
