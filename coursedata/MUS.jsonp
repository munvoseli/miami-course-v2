The History of Rock and Roll (3) MPF\n\nThis survey of Rock and Roll examines the roles the genre has played in the American imagination since the 1950s, and the perception and reception of the genre through time. It focuses on the ways that Rock fits into the narratives on American culture, gender and race, examining this music through the lens of politics, aesthetics, and society. The course progresses through the changing landscape of Rock from its roots in American popular culture in the early 20th century, continuing to the present day. The discussion continues through Metal and Hard Rock, to punk and disco, and much more. Students will learn to identify the formal, harmonic, rhythmic and textual characteristics that distinguish Rock subgenres. Through readings, films, demonstrations, class discussions and activities, and a great deal of music, this course explores the history of Rock and Roll, placing in context the musical, political and social forces that shaped its evolution and revolution.
