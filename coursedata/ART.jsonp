These regions and their arts, often relegated to the constructed category of ?non-Western,? will be considered from their religious, political, historical and cultural contexts. The course also explores the Western bias inherent in the study of ?non-Western? art, providing students with a broader understanding to the ways in which cultures from around the world produce, employ and conceptualize what the West has conventionally label as ?art.? In examining sculpture, multi-media installation, festivals, masquerade, textiles, dress, ritual spaces, international artists and many more, students are exposed to alternative ways of looking at and understanding visual and performed expression.

Modern & Contemporary East Asian Art (3)\n\nThis course is an investigation of the various modern and contemporary art movements in East Asia from the nineteenth century through the twenty-first century. What did the modern ideal mean in the various regions of China, Japan, Korea, and the diaspora? What forms did it take? The establishment of traditionalist movements will be equally as important to tracing the development of Asian modernism(s). Can one exist without the idea of the other?  Taking art objects and their related texts as our core evidence, this course will also consider the ways that the politics, literatures, popular cultures, and pasts of modern East Asia nations have intersected with one another and with the world.  Coming forward into the present, what does it mean to be an artist from East Asia in the contemporary art world of global biennials and art fairs? Key concepts will include: post-colonialism, Marxism, nationalism, socialism, gender, ethnicity, modernism, traditionalism, post-modernism, diaspora, etc.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-08-22","endDate":"2022-12-09","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"11:25","room":"103","buildingCode":"ART","buildingName":"Art Building","days":"MW","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"HATCHMJ","nameLast":"Hatch","nameFirst":"Michael","nameMiddle":"James","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Michael James Hatch","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Michael James Hatch","nameSortedInformal":"Hatch, Michael  James","nameSortedFormal":"Hatch, Michael James Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/HATCHMJ","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202310\/80063.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202310\/80063","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202310"},{"academicTerm":"202310","academicTermDesc":"Fall Semester 2022-23","courseId":"77014","recordNumber":"111","courseCode":"ART 331 A","schoolCode":"FA","schoolName":"College of Creative Arts","deptName":"Art","deptCode":"ART","standardizedDivisionCode":"CCA","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Creative Arts","standardizedDeptCode":"ART","standardizedDeptName":"Art","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"ART","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Art","courseTitle":"Painting II","instructionalType":"U","instructionalTypeDescription":"Studio","courseSubjectCode":"ART","courseSubjectDesc":"Art","courseNumber":"331","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"2","lectureHoursLow":"2","lectureHoursHigh":"2","labHoursDesc":"1","labHoursLow":"1","labHoursHigh":"1","enrollmentCountMax":"14","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"14","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-08-22","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-12-09","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"331 Painting II (3)\n\nPainting problems using both representational and abstract approaches in various painting media. 3 Lab. includes Lec.
