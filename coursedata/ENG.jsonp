This course focuses on texts that reflects medical experiences from the perspective of individual patients, practitioners and in the case of epidemics, societies. It uses reading, writing, thinking and discussion of those texts to investigate the different perspectives and belief systems that come into play in medical contexts, addressing issues of medical authority, end (quality) of life, the role of genre and technology in mediating the experience of illness, and the ways in which structural inequities in discourses of health are perpetuated.
