It will attend to diversity within groups by considering the dynamics of race as it intersects with gender, class, sexuality, dis\/ability, language, and religion. The course will also analyze the historical and ongoing exclusion and marginalization of minoritized groups, and the hegemonic dominance and normalization of whiteness in education policies, curriculum and pedagogy, assessment and achievement, teacher and student identities, school and classroom spaces, and family and community engagements. It will employ various conceptual frameworks to look inside educational structures and cultures that sustain inequities and that challenge and remedy them. Finally, the course will provide students with opportunities to investigate these issues as they relate to their own experiences and communities.
