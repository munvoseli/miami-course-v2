The century began with the vast Napoleonic expansion across Europe and ended with searching introspections about the notions of decadence and decay.  In literature, it gave rise to what are arguably the greatest achievements in French lyric poetry and the novel.  It created modern medicine both as a practice and a social force.  It invented large-scale speculative capitalism and the modern city.  This course will focus on exemplary aspects of nineteenth-century cultural production in France and may include literary, aesthetic, political, scientific, and philosophical trends.

With the rise of modernist urbanism, the city itself became a testing ground for ideas and ideologies that attempted to reenvision human nature.  By the thirties, these totalizing visions of a human future largely divided between communism and fascism, and Paris, as a capital of ideas and immigration, became the battleground for competing, militant images of humanity.  At the same time, the capital gazed out past the borders of France itself over an extensive colonial empire that returned vast riches at the cost of terrible moral and humanitarian injustices.  This course will examine literary and other cultural works from this turbulent period to better understand the scope, meaning, and stakes of the French twentieth century.

The century began with the vast Napoleonic expansion across Europe and ended with searching introspections about the notions of decadence and decay.  In literature, it gave rise to what are arguably the greatest achievements in French lyric poetry and the novel.  It created modern medicine both as a practice and a social force.  It invented large-scale speculative capitalism and the modern city.  This course will focus on exemplary aspects of nineteenth-century cultural production in France and may include literary, aesthetic, political, scientific, and philosophical trends.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-08-22","endDate":"2022-12-09","startTime":"13:15","endTime":"14:35","room":"220","buildingCode":"IRV","buildingName":"Irvin Hall","days":"TR","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"STRAUSJA","nameLast":"Strauss","nameFirst":"Jonathan","nameMiddle":"A.","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Jonathan A.

With the rise of modernist urbanism, the city itself became a testing ground for ideas and ideologies that attempted to reenvision human nature.  By the thirties, these totalizing visions of a human future largely divided between communism and fascism, and Paris, as a capital of ideas and immigration, became the battleground for competing, militant images of humanity.  At the same time, the capital gazed out past the borders of France itself over an extensive colonial empire that returned vast riches at the cost of terrible moral and humanitarian injustices.  This course will examine literary and other cultural works from this turbulent period to better understand the scope, meaning, and stakes of the French twentieth century.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-08-22","endDate":"2022-12-09","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"16:10","room":"224","buildingCode":"IRV","buildingName":"Irvin Hall","days":"MW","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"WASSERA3","nameLast":"Wasser","nameFirst":"Audrey","nameMiddle":"Catherine","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Audrey Catherine Wasser","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Audrey Catherine Wasser","nameSortedInformal":"Wasser, Audrey  Catherine","nameSortedFormal":"Wasser, Audrey Catherine Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/WASSERA3","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[{"term":"202310","crn":"78986","subjectCode":"FRE","courseNumber":"454"}],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202310\/78987.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202310\/78987","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202310"},{"academicTerm":"202310","academicTermDesc":"Fall Semester 2022-23","courseId":"79682","recordNumber":"39","courseCode":"FRE 600 A","schoolCode":"AS","schoolName":"College of Arts and Science","deptName":"French,Italian&Classical Stud","deptCode":"FRI","standardizedDivisionCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Arts & Science","standardizedDeptCode":"FRI","standardizedDeptName":"French, Italian & Classical Studies","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"FRI","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"French, Italian & Classical Studies","courseTitle":"Seminar In French Literature","instructionalType":"S","instructionalTypeDescription":"Seminar","courseSubjectCode":"FRE","courseSubjectDesc":"French","courseNumber":"600","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"1 to 4","creditHoursHigh":"4","creditHoursLow":"1","lectureHoursDesc":"1 to 4","lectureHoursLow":"1","lectureHoursHigh":"4","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"9","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"9","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-08-22","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-12-09","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"600 Seminar in French Literature (1-4)\n\nIntensive study of selected authors and critical perspectives.
