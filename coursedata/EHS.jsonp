The particular emphasis of this course is on fieldwork or a set of techniques involving firsthand contact between the researcher and those who are the subjects of the research. This includes training in observation, in-depth interviewing, visual and textual analysis, and secondary analysis of qualitative data. NOTE: Because this course is focused on the specialized topic of qualitative methodology, it is assumed that all students will have previously taken a course in basic research methods (e.g, KNH 295, FSW 295, EDL 654, KNH 621). This course is not designed to cover basic research methods. Prerequisites: EDL 654, KNH 621 or permission of instructor.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2023-01-23","endDate":"2023-05-12","startTime":"11:40","endTime":"13:00","room":"029","buildingCode":"PBD","buildingName":"Peabody Hall","days":"MW","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202320\/90578.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202320\/90578","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202320"},{"academicTerm":"202320","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2022-23","courseId":"87311","recordNumber":"2","courseCode":"EHS 649 A","schoolCode":"EA","schoolName":"Col of Educ, Health & Society","deptName":"Education, Health and Society","deptCode":"EHS","standardizedDivisionCode":"EHS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Education Health & Society","standardizedDeptCode":"CEHS","standardizedDeptName":"College of Education, Health & Society","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"CEHS","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"College of Education, Health & Society","courseTitle":"Action Research for Educators","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"EHS","courseSubjectDesc":"Education, Health and Society","courseNumber":"649","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"10","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"10","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2023-01-23","partOfTermEndDate":"2023-05-12","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"649 Action Research for Educators (3)  \n\nEngages educators in action research as a way to study and improve, through informed decision-making, the dynamics of one's own practice.
