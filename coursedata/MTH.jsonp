Review of algebra topics important for calculus. Functions, polynomials, rational functions, logarithmic and exponential functions, trigonometric functions and their inverses, conic sections, nonlinear systems, and applications of functions. Credit does not count toward a major in mathematics and statistics. Note: Students who have credit for MTH 151 or a higher mathematics class may not enroll in MTH 125. The only exceptions are when a student audits the course or meets the criteria of the Course Repeat Policy, as stated in the Student Handbook.
