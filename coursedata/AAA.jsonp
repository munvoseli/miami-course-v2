In the past half century, many countries in Asia have undergone significant political, economic, social, and cultural changes, which are tightly intertwined with the concepts and tenets of globalization. With countries such as China and India on the rise, and global superpowers such as Russia and Japan encountering their own modern challenges, the Asian continent has been facing a transformation that is at once a response to globalization and itself a powerful force influencing global community. Accordingly, the course highlights cross-cultural values through a comparative lens of Asia and globalization, and aims to study recent transformations in Asia and their impact on its own future and the world. The study will be framed both in the Asian internal context and in the external context of globalization. The course specifically focuses on, though is not limited to, how external global influence and the internal cultures of major Asian countries interact with each other in ways that uniquely mark and inform the economic, social, religious, educational, and cultural transformations in Asia.\nIIC, IIIB.
