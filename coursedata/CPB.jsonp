An integrated approach will be used to study fundamental concepts in transport phenomena including: fluid properties, mechanics of fluids, dimensional analysis, steady and transient flow regimes, steady and unsteady conduction, forced and free convection, radiation heat transfer, laminar and turbulent flow, heat exchangers, mass diffusion, and interphase transport. Analogy of heat, mass, and momentum transport phenomena principles will be presented.
