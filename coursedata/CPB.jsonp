Through the course and using their background in mass and energy balances, thermodynamics, and transport phenomena, students will characterize and design heat exchangers and separation unit operations, including absorption, distillation, membranes, drying and crystallization processes. At the end of the course, students will understand the application of each unit operation within a chemical process and use computational tools to aid in separation design.
