Hydrogeological Modeling: Groundwater Flow and Contaminant Transport and Fate (4)\n\nExplores techniques used in constructing and solving mathematical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. It reviews and covers the basic theory associated with these processes including the physical processes that govern the flow of groundwater in various geologic media and settings and the chemical, biological and physical processes involved in contaminant transport and fate in groundwater systems. The course explores how to incorporate our understanding of these various processes into numerical models that help us explore and come to a better understanding of natural systems and make predictions. The course also develops familiarity some widely-used packaged models while learning about grid and boundary design, model parameter-value selection, calibration and exploration of uncertainty.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"11:00","room":"009","buildingCode":"SHD","buildingName":"Shideler Hall","days":"MWF","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"},{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"16:05","room":"242","buildingCode":"SHD","buildingName":"Shideler Hall","days":"R","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"LEVYJ","nameLast":"Levy","nameFirst":"Jonathan","nameMiddle":null,"namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Jonathan Levy","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Jonathan Levy","nameSortedInformal":"Levy, Jonathan ","nameSortedFormal":"Levy, Jonathan Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/LEVYJ","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/89893.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/89893","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"89896","recordNumber":"67","courseCode":"GLG 432 A","schoolCode":"AS","schoolName":"College of Arts and Science","deptName":"Geology","deptCode":"GLG","standardizedDivisionCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Arts & Science","standardizedDeptCode":"GLG","standardizedDeptName":"Geology & Environmental Earth Science","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"GLG","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Geology & Environmental Earth Science","courseTitle":"Xray Powder Diff&Clay Analysis","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"GLG","courseSubjectDesc":"Geology","courseNumber":"432","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"14","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"14","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"432\/532 X-ray Powder Diffraction and Clay Analysis (3) \n\nCovers one of the most utilized analytical methods in geology and materials characterization, powder X-ray diffraction.

Hydrogeological Modeling: Groundwater Flow and Contaminant Transport and Fate (3)\n\nThis course explores techniques used in constructing and solving mathematical models of groundwater flow and contaminant transport. It reviews and covers the basic theory associated with these processes including the physical processes that govern the flow of groundwater in various geologic media and settings and the chemical, biological and physical processes involved in contaminant transport and fate in groundwater systems. The course explores how to incorporate our understanding of these various processes into numerical models that help us explore and come to a better understanding of natural systems and make predictions. The course also develops familiarity some widely-used packaged models while learning about grid and boundary design, model parameter-value selection, calibration and exploration of uncertainty.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"10:05","endTime":"11:00","room":"009","buildingCode":"SHD","buildingName":"Shideler Hall","days":"MWF","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"},{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"14:15","endTime":"16:05","room":"242","buildingCode":"SHD","buildingName":"Shideler Hall","days":"R","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"LEVYJ","nameLast":"Levy","nameFirst":"Jonathan","nameMiddle":null,"namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Jonathan Levy","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Jonathan Levy","nameSortedInformal":"Levy, Jonathan ","nameSortedFormal":"Levy, Jonathan Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/LEVYJ","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/89894.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/89894","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"89897","recordNumber":"100","courseCode":"GLG 532 A","schoolCode":"AS","schoolName":"College of Arts and Science","deptName":"Geology","deptCode":"GLG","standardizedDivisionCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Arts & Science","standardizedDeptCode":"GLG","standardizedDeptName":"Geology & Environmental Earth Science","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"GLG","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Geology & Environmental Earth Science","courseTitle":"Xray Powder Diff&Clay Analysis","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"GLG","courseSubjectDesc":"Geology","courseNumber":"532","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"5","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"5","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"432\/532 X-ray Powder Diffraction and Clay Analysis (3)\n\nStudy of the structure, composition, properties, uses, and environmental significance of clays and clay minerals.
