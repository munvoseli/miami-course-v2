Water and Society (3) MPT\n\nProvides a basic scientific understanding of what water is, where it resides and how it moves throughout the entire hydrologic cycle both on a global and watershed scale. Topics emphasize the importance and fragility of water resources and the world-wide threats to those resources. Major issues examined include flooding, water scarcity, irrigation, settlement of arid land, international water conflict and contamination of drinking water supplies. Topics are examined not only through a natural science perspective, but also through perspectives of history, policy, law and societal attitudes.
