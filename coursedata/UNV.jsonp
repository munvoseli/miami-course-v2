The course serves a number of purposes, such as: providing orientation and overview of relevant university resources, exposing students to examples of ongoing research at the university, covering content material on how to design and conduct research, locating and retrieving source material for research projects, designing an appropriate study to address a research question, and socializing students within a community of scholars. It is expected that students will complete UNV 172 in the subsequent semester, after which they will be adequately trained to partake in supervised yet independent research or creative activity with a faculty mentor, or other similar endeavors of their choosing.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-02-07","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"16:25","endTime":"17:30","room":"120","buildingCode":"MCG","buildingName":"McGuffey Hall","days":"R","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/84511.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/84511","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"90494","recordNumber":"6","courseCode":"UNV 171H A","schoolCode":"AS","schoolName":"College of Arts and Science","deptName":"College of Arts and Science","deptCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Arts & Science","standardizedDeptCode":"UNV","standardizedDeptName":"University","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"UNV","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"University","courseTitle":"First-Year Research I","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"UNV","courseSubjectDesc":"University","courseNumber":"171H","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"1 to 3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"1","lectureHoursDesc":"1 to 3","lectureHoursLow":"1","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"30","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"30","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":null,"prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"11:40","endTime":"12:35","room":"407","buildingCode":"PBD","buildingName":"Peabody Hall","days":"F","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"DILEKY","nameLast":"Dilek","nameFirst":"Yildirim","nameMiddle":null,"namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Yildirim Dilek","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Yildirim Dilek","nameSortedInformal":"Dilek, Yildirim ","nameSortedFormal":"Dilek, Yildirim Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/DILEKY","primaryInstructor":"true"},{"username":"JOHNSOJG","nameLast":"Johnson","nameFirst":"Joseph","nameMiddle":"G.","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Joseph G.
