Opening Minds through Art (OMA) Leadership Experience (2; maximum 6)\n\nOMA is an intergenerational visual art program for people with dementia. It is grounded in the belief that people with dementia are capable of expressing themselves creatively. Its approach is to capitalize on what people with dementia can still do. OMA currently offers its program at multiple sites that serve people with dementia in long-term care facilities, adult day centers and those living at home. OMA has four primary goals: 1) to promote the social engagement, autonomy, and dignity of people with dementia by providing creative self-expression opportunities; 2) to provide staff and volunteers with opportunities to build close relationships with people with dementia; 3) to show the public the creative self-expression capacities of people with dementia through exhibitions of their artwork; and 4) to contribute to the scholarly literature on dementia care and the arts. In this Service-Learning course you will have a leadership role in OMA. EL, IC.
