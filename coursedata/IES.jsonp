If words are key to human survival of climate change, then the study of language and literature matters now more than ever. Accordingly, this course asks: What can words do at a time of environmental crisis? How can literature help us perceive, understand, analyze, narrate, and respond within a continually changing ecology? The class explores environmental writing across different genres, communities, and time periods, considering intersections of race, class, gender, sexuality, and environment; concepts of nature and culture; and human relations with the more-than-human world.
