Using industry standard tools, students will learn to design, implement, and refine interactive media for specific audiences. For the purpose of this class, interactive media includes a variety of software and hardware solutions that intersect the domain of human-computer interaction.

The web and mobile focus will lead to rudimentary discussions on client\/server architectures and what content delivery choices are available when a mobile device, such as a smartphone or a tablet, has such strong technical capabilities.

In this class, students work with a real client to evaluate and redesign an existing interface. As part of this engagement, students are assigned to small groups. They have client contact and consider and carry out the user experience research methodologies (including eye tracking and facial expression analysis) that will be most helpful to their client. After analyzing the data, teams then decide on an interactive design approach to take and work through the steps to build wireframes and a clickable prototype. Finally, they prepare a written recommendations report and client presentation. There is no coding involved.
