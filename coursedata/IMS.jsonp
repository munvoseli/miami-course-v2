Through building simple prototypes, students will learn how to use a variety of switches and sensors, how to build circuits for them, and various ways microcontrollers (like Arduino) can be used with them as well as interface with a variety of computing systems and software. We will prototype using various design lenses including form, function, accessibility, and immersion.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":"14:50","endTime":"16:10","room":"215","buildingCode":"LWS","buildingName":"Laws Hall","days":"MW","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"WEISLIA","nameLast":"Weisling","nameFirst":"Anna","nameMiddle":null,"namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Anna Weisling","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Anna Weisling","nameSortedInformal":"Weisling, Anna ","nameSortedFormal":"Weisling, Anna Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/WEISLIA","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/90421.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/90421","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"87154","recordNumber":"41","courseCode":"IMS 254 A","schoolCode":"FA","schoolName":"College of Creative Arts","deptName":"Emerging Tech: Business&Design","deptCode":"IMS","standardizedDivisionCode":"CCA","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Creative Arts","standardizedDeptCode":"IMS","standardizedDeptName":"Interactive Media Studies","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"IMS","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Interactive Media Studies","courseTitle":"Design Thinking & Principles","instructionalType":"S","instructionalTypeDescription":"Seminar","courseSubjectCode":"IMS","courseSubjectDesc":"Emerging Tech: Business&Design","courseNumber":"254","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"19","enrollmentCountCurrent":"1","enrollmentCountActive":"1","enrollmentCountAvailable":"18","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"254 Design Thinking & Design Principles Applied (3) (MPF)\n\nAn understanding of design thinking & design principles is central to the creation of digital solutions and interfaces.

Social media are living conversations that present marketers with the challenge of how to understand and participate in those conversations in an authentic and value-based manner. Moreover, these conversations don't happen in a vacuum. The connected nature of different social (and physical) relationships define a community of interest. The community manager uses this entire space to help bring value to this community.
