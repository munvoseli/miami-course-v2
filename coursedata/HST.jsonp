The predominant theme is that of the increasing influence of medical theory and  medical institutions on society, and the growing concern of the state with public health.  The course includes an exploration of the connections between medicine and ideas about class, race, gender, nation, and disease.

Places the development of racial theories of sickness and health in a broad social and political context, and, in particular, explains the medical salience of race in the settings of slavery and colonialism. Discussions will focus primarily on Latin America, the Caribbean, and the United States, but will also explore the making of knowledge about race in global setting.
