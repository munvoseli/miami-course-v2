Developing Identity and Pride from Practice (3) \n\nExplores what it means to be ally to\/in\/with the disability community in America.  The course emphasizes identity formation and how that formation can inform the construction of the ally identity.  Through deconstructing learned values, knowledge, and images of disability that mitigate ally behavior, students discover the micro and macro structures that support ally behavior. By exploring how social control and social change have worked in other civil rights movements, students understand the necessity of identifying and including allies in the disability movement for civil rights.
