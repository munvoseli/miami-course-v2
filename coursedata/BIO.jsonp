In this course, participants study the science of climate change, the diverse causes of climate change, and the impact of climate change at local, regional, and global scales. Topics include global warming's effect on weather and climate, ice caps, deforestation, and species conservation. Because the public plays a central role in how the world responds to climate change, students also investigate the factors that guide public perception, ranging from media to social interaction. Students explore the effect of climate change specific to the biology of their local region and consider what actions they and their communities can take locally. Through project assignments and research, at the end of this course participants not only have a solid understanding of current issues surrounding climate change but will also have considered and developed strategies for taking action. This is a hybrid course with interaction on-site and in Dragonfly's web-based learning community.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2022-01-24","endDate":"2022-05-13","startTime":null,"endTime":null,"room":null,"buildingCode":"WEB","buildingName":"Web-Based Curriculum","days":null,"scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[],"attributes":[{"attributeCode":"MDT","attributeDescription":"Market Driven Tuition"},{"attributeCode":"ONLA","attributeDescription":"Online Asynchronous"}],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202220\/88146.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202220\/88146","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202220"},{"academicTerm":"202220","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2021-22","courseId":"85569","recordNumber":"290","courseCode":"BIO 639 A","schoolCode":"AS","schoolName":"College of Arts and Science","deptName":"Biology","deptCode":"BIO","standardizedDivisionCode":"CAS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Arts & Science","standardizedDeptCode":"BIO","standardizedDeptName":"Biology","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"BIO","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Biology","courseTitle":"Master's Capstone: MAT","instructionalType":"S","instructionalTypeDescription":"Seminar","courseSubjectCode":"BIO","courseSubjectDesc":"Biology","courseNumber":"639","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"2","creditHoursHigh":"2","creditHoursLow":"2","lectureHoursDesc":"2","lectureHoursLow":"2","lectureHoursHigh":"2","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"0","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"0","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-01-24","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-05-13","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"639 Master's Capstone: MAT (2)\n\nA required exit course for students earning a Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) in the Biological Sciences as part of the Advanced Inquiry Program (AIP) or the Global Field Program (GFP) master's degrees from Miami University.
