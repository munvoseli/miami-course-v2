Our primary goal over the next several weeks is to systematically examine elections in the United States.  We will act as social science researchers to answer some interesting questions: What is the role of voters, campaigns and elections in a democracy?  Why are campaigns and elections important in a democracy?  We will examine in detail how voters decide to choose a representative.  We will examine election campaigns, focusing specifically on whether campaigns matter, how they can be studied systematically, and how candidates strategize in modern elections.
