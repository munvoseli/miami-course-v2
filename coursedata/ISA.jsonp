However, these solutions are no longer sufficient. Businesses are transitioning to a new era, where cybersecurity is enhanced and almost requires data-driven analytical solutions. The primarily goals of data-driven security are to: a) discover malicious patterns from the data-lakes of logs produced by security software, b) develop automated tools that can assist in the surveillance of security-related data. This course covers various analytic applications in information\/ cybersecurity including: user behavior analysis, network and host intrusion detection, web security, phishing detection, and emerging issues in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) security.
