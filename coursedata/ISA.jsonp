Using the knowledge from this class, the students will model real-world business problems in the domains of: supply chain management, human resource management, finance, accounting, economics and\/or marketing.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[{"startDate":"2023-01-23","endDate":"2023-05-12","startTime":"08:30","endTime":"09:50","room":"0013","buildingCode":"FSB","buildingName":"Farmer School of Business","days":"TR","scheduleTypeCode":"CLAS","scheduleTypeDescription":"Class"}],"instructors":[{"username":"WEESEML","nameLast":"Weese","nameFirst":"Maria","nameMiddle":"Louise","namePrefix":"Dr.","nameSuffix":null,"nameFirstPreferred":null,"nameDisplayInformal":"Maria Louise Weese","nameDisplayFormal":"Dr. Maria Louise Weese","nameSortedInformal":"Weese, Maria  Louise","nameSortedFormal":"Weese, Maria Louise Dr.","personResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/person\/WEESEML","primaryInstructor":"true"}],"attributes":[{"attributeCode":"BUS","attributeDescription":"Bus Course for Surcharge"}],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202320\/88795.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202320\/88795","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202320"},{"academicTerm":"202320","academicTermDesc":"Spring Semester 2022-23","courseId":"88794","recordNumber":"91","courseCode":"ISA 634 A","schoolCode":"BU","schoolName":"Farmer School of Business","deptName":"Information Systems& Analytics","deptCode":"ISA","standardizedDivisionCode":"FSB","standardizedDivisionName":"Farmer School of Business","standardizedDeptCode":"ISA","standardizedDeptName":"Information Systems & Analytics","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"ISA","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Information Systems & Analytics","courseTitle":"Analytics Solution Deployment","instructionalType":"L","instructionalTypeDescription":"Lecture","courseSubjectCode":"ISA","courseSubjectDesc":"Information Systems& Analytics","courseNumber":"634","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"3","creditHoursHigh":"3","creditHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursDesc":"3","lectureHoursLow":"3","lectureHoursHigh":"3","labHoursDesc":" ","labHoursLow":" ","labHoursHigh":" ","enrollmentCountMax":"0","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"0","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2023-01-23","partOfTermEndDate":"2023-05-12","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"634 Analytics Solution Deployment and Lifecycle Management (3)\n\nThis course will introduce students to current and emerging methods and technologies for deploying  and managing analytical solutions in practice.The emphasis will be on how organizations embed analytical solutions into corporate technology systems and infrastructures to make the solutions consumable.
