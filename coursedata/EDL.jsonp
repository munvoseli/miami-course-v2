The ecological observations of this first course will be heavily influenced by the seasonal transition from summer into winter that occurs during the fall semester. From these observations, the class will create a shared understanding of the web of relationships that links humans, animals, plants, landscapes, other-than-human beings, and the stories that one particular group of humans \"the Myaamiaki\" have told about these interactions over time. Through an exploration of some of the general aspects of Myaamia ecology and history, each individual participant of the class will begin develop their own personalized understanding of this complex web of relationships. Half of the class meetings will be dedicated to discussing historical topics, i.e. focused on the past, but one of our explicit goals is to discuss how historical understandings and ecological practices are a part of, or can be made a part of, our contemporary lives.","prntInd":"Y","courseSchedules":[],"instructors":[],"attributes":[],"crossListedCourses":[],"courseSectionResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/courseSectionV2\/202310\/78551.json","enrollmentResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/enrollments\/section\/202310\/78551","academicTermResource":"https:\/\/ws.miamioh.edu\/academicTerms\/202310"},{"academicTerm":"202310","academicTermDesc":"Fall Semester 2022-23","courseId":"79093","recordNumber":"27","courseCode":"EDL 222 A","schoolCode":"EA","schoolName":"Col of Educ, Health & Society","deptName":"Educational Leadership","deptCode":"EDL","standardizedDivisionCode":"EHS","standardizedDivisionName":"College of Education Health & Society","standardizedDeptCode":"EDL","standardizedDeptName":"Educational Leadership","traditionalStandardizedDeptCode":"EDL","traditionalStandardizedDeptName":"Educational Leadership","courseTitle":"Mindfulness Contemplative Intr","instructionalType":"S","instructionalTypeDescription":"Seminar","courseSubjectCode":"EDL","courseSubjectDesc":"Educational Leadership","courseNumber":"222","courseSectionCode":"A","courseStatus":"Active","campusCode":"O","campusName":"Oxford","creditHoursDesc":"1","creditHoursHigh":"1","creditHoursLow":"1","lectureHoursDesc":" ","lectureHoursLow":" ","lectureHoursHigh":" ","labHoursDesc":"1","labHoursLow":"1","labHoursHigh":"1","enrollmentCountMax":"20","enrollmentCountCurrent":"0","enrollmentCountActive":"0","enrollmentCountAvailable":"20","partOfTermCode":"1","partOfTermName":"Full Semester","partOfTermStartDate":"2022-08-22","partOfTermEndDate":"2022-12-09","midtermGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","finalGradeSubmissionAvailable":"N","gradeRequiredFinal":"true","courseDescription":"222 Mindfulness Contemplative Intr (1; maximum 5)\n\nThe course is an introduction to mindfulness and contemplative practices (movement, ritual, creative, relational, activist, generative, stillness) their global\/cultural histories, readings, and reflection.
