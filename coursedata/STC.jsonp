Yet, every day, brands and individuals face crises and loss of trust. Every brand faces negative attention at some point - it is just a matter of when and how much the situation damages brand reputation. Using real-life case studies, this course prepares students to identify, navigate and manage reputations in crisis. Introducing key principles of issue, risk, and crisis communication management, this course integrates theories in crisis communication research.
