Contemporary Physics I: Foundations (3) MPT\n\nThird course in a sequence that begins with two semesters expounding the visions of Newton, Schrodinger, Boltzmann, Maxwell, and Einstein. Incorporates a focus approach that emphasizes Nobel prize-winning physics occurring within the lifetime of the student. Presently, the foci are the scanning tunneling microscope, high-Tc superconductivity, and the \"standard model\" for particle physics. Topics include quantum mechanics in three dimensions, solid state physics, quantum optics, and particle physics. Prerequisite: PHY 192.
