Emphasizes scientific inquiry in an activity-based, cooperative-learning approach. Goals are to develop basic physical concepts and the scientific reasoning skills necessary to apply them to the natural world and to serve as a model for the transfer of the methods of inquiry-based instruction and authentic assessment to the precollege classroom. Topics selected from properties of matter, thermodynamics, electricity, optics, kinematics, and astronomy. Assessments include laboratory notebook and journal writing, discussion, and developing and teaching inquiry lessons.
